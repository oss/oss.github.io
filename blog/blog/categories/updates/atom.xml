    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're back, now with a shiny new blog powered by <a href="https://octopress.org">Octopress</a>.</p>

<p>While waiting for hurricane Sandy to knock the power out last week, I got around to looking at some of the code I had written for the last version of this blog and realized it really wasn't very good. I had also just recently deployed my own blog with Octopress, and learned enough <a href="https://compass-style.org/">sass</a> that I figured I could restyle it to look almost exactly like the old website. It turned out to be a <em>bit</em> more complicated than I expected ( I didn't realize how it resized things as you resize the window ), but I mananged to get it all working just in time for the power to go out.</p>
